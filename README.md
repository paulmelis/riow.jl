# Ray-tracing in one Weekend

A Julia implementation of Peter Shirley's "Ray Tracing in One Weekend" 
(https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html).

## Notes

* Fairly straight-forward port from the C++ code, but with some 
  tweaks to make it fit Julia better. Lots of extra optimization 
  possible.
* Not multi-threaded (yet)
