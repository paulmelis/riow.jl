# Ray-tracing in One Weekend

A Julia implementation of Peter Shirley's [*Ray Tracing in One Weekend*](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html).

Note that this was one of my first projects in Julia, 
hence not everything follows conventions (especially w.r.t. 
packaging). 

Plus, there's probably a lot of optimizations that can still be done.

## Notes

* Fairly straight-forward port from the C++ code, but with some 
  tweaks to make it fit Julia better.
* Not multi-threaded (yet)
